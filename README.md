# PYTHON TO APK CONVERSION VIA GOOGLE COLAB
This repository provides a streamlined solution for developers encountering difficulties when compiling Python (.py) files into Android (.apk) packages.

--- INSTALLATION & SETUP ---

1. DOWNLOAD THE FILES:
   - Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".

2. EXTRACT THE ARCHIVE:
   - Locate the downloaded .zip file on your computer.
   - Right-click the file and select "Extract All..." or use your preferred unzipping software (e.g., 7-Zip, WinRAR).
   - Choose a destination folder and complete the extraction.
   - Note for Linux users: You can use an online unzip tool if you prefer not to use the terminal.

3. LOCATE THE Compile.bat:
   - Navigate to the newly extracted folder: py-to-apk-with-Google-Colab/Compile/

--- EXECUTION ---

4. RUN THE Compile.bat:
   - Execute the "Compile.bat" file.
   - This script will automatically open the site https://colab.research.google.com/ and launch the local instruction file: py-to-apk-with-Google-Colab/Compile/Source/README.txt
   - Note for Linux users: Since the automated script is designed for Windows, Linux users (like myself) will need to perform this step manually.

5. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS:
   - Follow the step-by-step guide in the README.txt to finish the build within the Google Colab environment.
